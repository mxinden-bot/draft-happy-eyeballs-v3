--- abstract

Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
which may have different performance and connectivity
characteristics. Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
establishing a connection more quickly. This document defines the
algorithm for "Happy Eyeballs", a technique for reducing user-visible
delays on dual-stack hosts. This document updates the algorithm
in RFC 8305.

# Introduction

Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
which may have different performance and connectivity
characteristics. Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
establishing a connection more quickly.

This document defines the algorithm for "Happy Eyeballs", a technique
for reducing user-visible delays on dual-stack hosts. This
definition updates the description in {{?HEV2=RFC8305}}, which
itself obsoleted {{?RFC6555}}.

The Happy Eyeballs algorithm of racing connections to resolved
endpoints has several stages to avoid delays to the user whenever
possible, while respecting client priorities, such as preferring
the use of IPv6 or the availability of protocols like HTTP/3 {{?HTTP3=RFC9114}} and
TLS Encrypted Client Hello {{!ECH=RFC9849}}. This document discusses
how to initiate DNS queries when starting a connection, how to
sort the list of destination addresses received from DNS answers,
and how to race the connection attempts.

The major difference between the algorithm defined in this document
and {{HEV2}} is the addition of support for SVCB / HTTPS resource
records {{!SVCB=RFC9460}}. SVCB records provide alternative
endpoints and information about application protocol support, Encrypted
Client Hello {{ECH}} keys, address hints, and other relevant details
about the services being accessed. Discovering protocol support during
resolution, such as for HTTP/3 over QUIC {{HTTP3}}, allows
upgrading between protocols on the current connection attempts,
instead of waiting for subsequent attempts to use information from
other discovery mechanisms such as HTTP Alternative Services
{{?AltSvc=RFC7838}}. These records can be queried along with A and
AAAA records, and the updated algorithm defines how to handle SVCB
responses to improve connection establishment.

#  Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# Overview

This document defines a method of connection establishment, named the
"Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup". This approach has several
distinct phases:

1. Asynchronous resolution of a hostname into destination endpoints ({{resolution}})

1. Sorting of the resolved destination endpoints ({{sorting}})

1. Initiation of asynchronous connection attempts ({{connections}})

1. Successful establishment of one connection and cancellation of
other attempts ({{connections}})

Note that this document assumes that the preference policy for the
destination address family favors IPv6 over IPv4. IPv6 has many
desirable properties designed to be improvements over IPv4
{{?IPV6=RFC8200}}.

This document also assumes that the preference policy favors QUIC over
TCP. QUIC only requires one packet to establish a secure connection,
making it quicker compared to TCP {{?QUIC=RFC9000}}.

If the host is configured to have different preferences, the
recommendations in this document can be easily adapted.

# Hostname Resolution {#resolution}

When a client is trying to establish a connection to a named host,
it needs to determine which destination endpoint it can use
to establish a connection. The client resolves the endpoints
by sending DNS queries and collecting the answers.
This section describes how a client initiates DNS queries
and asynchronously handles the answers.

## Sending DNS Queries {#queries}

Clients first need to determine which DNS resource records
they will include in queries for a named host.

This decision is based on whether the client has "connectivity" using IPv4
and/or IPv6 on the current Provisioning Domain (PvD) {{?PvD=RFC7556}}.
Generally, "connectivity" for an address family is defined
as having at least one non-loopback and and non-link-local ({{!RFC3927}},{{!RFC4291}})
address of that address family from which to send packets, and at
least one non-link local route for the address family. When there is
IPv6 connectivity, the client MUST include a query for AAAA records.
When there is IPv4 connectivity, the client MUST include a query for
A records. Additionally, if the client has detected a NAT64 prefix
({{!NAT64=RFC6146}}) on the network, the client MUST include a query
for A records (see {{nat64}} for more details on detecting the NAT64 prefix
and handling answers).


In addition to requesting AAAA and A records, depending on which
application is establishing the connection, clients can request
either SVCB or HTTPS records {{SVCB}}. For applications using
HTTP or HTTPS (including applications using WebSockets), the
client SHOULD send a query for HTTPS records.

All of the DNS queries SHOULD be made as soon after one another as
possible. The order in which the queries are sent SHOULD be as
follows (omitting any query that doesn't apply based on the
logic described above):

1. SVCB or HTTPS query
1. AAAA query
1. A query

## Handling DNS Answers Asynchronously

Once the client receives sufficient answers to its DNS queries, it can
move onto the phases of sorting endpoints ({{sorting}})
and establishing connections ({{connections}}).

Implementations SHOULD NOT wait for all answers to return
before starting the next steps of connection establishment. If one query
fails or takes significantly longer to return, waiting for
those answers can significantly delay connection
establishment that could otherwise proceed with already received answers.

Therefore, the client SHOULD treat DNS resolution as asynchronous,
processing different record types independently.
Note that if the platform does not offer an asynchronous DNS API,
this behavior can be simulated by making separate synchronous queries
for each record type in parallel.

The client moves onto sorting endpoints and establishing connections
once one of the following condition sets is met:

Either:

- Some positive (non-empty) address answers have been received AND
- A postive (non-empty) or negative (empty) answer has been received
for the preferred address family that was queried AND
- SVCB/HTTPS service information has been received (or has received
a negative response)

Or:

- Some positive (non-empty) address answers have been received AND
- A resolution time delay has passed after which other answers have
not been received

Positive answers can be IP addresses received either from AAAA or A
records, or IP address hints received directly in SVCB/HTTPS records.

Negative answers are exclusively responses to AAAA or A records
that contain no IP addresses (with or without an error like NXDOMAIN).
If all answers come back with negative answers, the
connection establishment will fail or need to wait until other answers
are received.

On networks that have both default routes for IPv6 and IPv4, IPv6 is
assumed to be the preferred address family. If only one of IPv6 or IPv4 has
a default route, that address family should be considered the preferred address
family for progressing the algorithm.

The resolution time delay is a short time that provides a chance
to receive preferred addresses (via AAAA records) along
with service information (via SVCB/HTTPS records). This accounts
for the case where the AAAA or SVCB/HTTPS records follow the
A records by a few milliseconds. This delay is referred to as
the "Resolution Delay".

The RECOMMENDED value for the Resolution Delay is 50 milliseconds.

### Resolving SVCB/HTTPS Aliases and Targets

SVCB and HTTPS records describe information for network services. Individual
records are either AliasMode or ServiceMode records, where AliasMode requires
another SVCB/HTTPS query for the alias name. ServiceMode records either are
associated with the original name being queried, in which case their TargetName
is ".", or are associated with another service name (see {{Section 2.5 of SVCB}}).

The algorithm in this document does not consider service information to be received
until ServiceMode records are available.

ServiceMode records can contain IP address hints via `ipv6hint` and `ipv4hint`
parameters. When these are received, they SHOULD be considered as positive
non-empty answers for the purpose of the algorithm when A and AAAA records
corresponding to the TargetName are not available yet. Note that clients are
still required to issue A and AAAA queries for those TargetNames if they haven't
yet received those records. When those records are received, they replace the hints
and update the available set of responses as new answers (see {{new-answers}}).

### Examples

The following examples provide various sequences that might be seen for receiving
DNS answers, in order to show how the logic described above is used in
practice to determine when to move onto the sorting and connecting phases.

A simple dual-stack case where AAAA answers return slight before A answers:

~~~ aasvg
 Client                    DNS Server
   |    HTTPS?  --->            |
   |     AAAA?  --->            |
   |        A?  --->            |
   |                            |
   |        (30ms delay)        |
   |                            |
   |    <--- HTTPS (no hints)   |
   |    <--- AAAA (2 addresses) |

   |                            |

A case in which A answers return before AAAA answers, but AAAA
answers do arrive after a short delay:

   |        A?  --->            |

   |    <--- AAAA (2 addresses) |
   |                            |
   | Start w/IPv6 + IPv4        |
   |                            |

   | Start w/IPv4               |
   |                            |
~~~

## Handling New Answers {#new-answers}

If new records arrive while connection attempts are in progress,
but before any connection has been established, then any newly
received endpoints are incorporated into the list of available candidate
endpoints (see {{changes}}) and the process of connection attempts will
continue with the new endpoints added, until one connection is
established.

## Handling Expired Answers

Previously received DNS answers might expire (exceed their TTL)
while connection attempts are still in progress. A Happy Eyeballs client will not cancel those ongoing attempts when the answers
expire. However, the client MAY trigger new DNS queries to fetch non-expired answers after the original records have expired,
in the case in which the original answers have not yet led to a successful connection.
Addition of any new answers is handled as described in {{new-answers}} and {{changes}}; that is, ongoing connection attempts
will not be cancelled, but any endpoint for which a connection
attempt had not yet been started that is no longer in the resolved
endpoint list will be removed.

Additionally, the fact that Happy Eyeballs enables clients to handle
updates to the resolved endpoint list asynchronously enables
the use of expired answers "optimistically" while waiting for non-expired
answers. This approach is called "optimistic DNS", and is described
in {{?OPTIMISTIC-DNS=I-D.gakiwate-dnsop-optimistic-dns}}.

## Handling Multiple DNS Server Addresses

If multiple DNS server addresses are configured for the current
network, the client may have the option of sending its DNS queries
over IPv4 or IPv6. In keeping with the Happy Eyeballs approach,
queries SHOULD be sent over IPv6 first (note that this is not
referring to the sending of AAAA or A queries, but rather the address
of the DNS server itself and IP version used to transport DNS
messages). If DNS queries sent to the IPv6 address do not receive
responses, that address may be marked as penalized and queries can be
sent to other DNS server addresses.

As native IPv6 deployments become more prevalent and IPv4 addresses
are exhausted, it is expected that IPv6 connectivity will have
preferential treatment within networks. If a DNS server is
configured to be accessible over IPv6, IPv6 should be assumed to be
the preferred address family.

Client systems SHOULD NOT have an explicit limit to the number of DNS
servers that can be configured, either manually or by the network.
If such a limit is required by hardware limitations, the client
SHOULD use at least one address from each address family from the
available list.

# Grouping and Sorting Endpoints {#sorting}

Before attempting to connect to any of the resolved destination
endpoints, the client defines the order in which to start the
attempts. Once the order has been defined, the client can use a
simple algorithm for racing each option after a short delay (see
{{connections}}). It is important that the ordered list involves all
endpoints from both address families and all protocols that have been received
by this point, as this allows the client to get the racing effect of
Happy Eyeballs for the entire list, not just the first IPv4 and first
IPv6 addresses.

The client performs three levels of grouping
and sorting of endpoints based on the DNS answers received.
Each subsequent level of sorting only changes orders and
preferences within the previously defined groups.

1. Grouping and sorting by application protocol and security requirements ({{application-group}})
1. Grouping and sorting by service priorities ({{service-group}})
1. Sorting by destination endpoint preferences ({{endpoint-sorting}})

## Grouping By Application Protocols and Security Requirements {#application-group}

Clients first group based on which application protocols the
destination endpoints support and which security features
those endpoints offer. These are based on
information from SVCB/HTTPS records about application-layer protocols
("alpn" values) and other parameters like TLS Encrypted Client Hello
configuration ("ech" values, see {{!SVCB-ECH=RFC9848}}).

For cases where the answers do not include any SVCB/HTTPS information,
or if all of the answers are associated with the same SVCB/HTTPS record,
this step is trivial: all answers belong to one group, and the client
assumes they support the same protocols and security properties.

However, the client is aware of different sets of destination endpoints
that advertise different capabilities when it receives multiple distinct
SVCB/HTTPS records. The client SHOULD separate these
endpoints into different groups, such that all endpoints in a
group share the same application protocols and relevant security
properties. The specific parameters that are relevant to the client
depend on the client implementation and application.

Note that some destination endpoints might need to be added to
multiple groups at this stage. For example, consider the following
HTTPS records:

~~~
 example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc1.example.com. (
     alpn="h3,h2" ipv6hint=2001:db8::2 )
 example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc2.example.com. (
     alpn="h2" ipv6hint=2001:db8::4 )
~~~

In this case, 2001:db8::2 can be used with HTTP/3 and HTTP/2,
but 2001:db8::4 can only be used with HTTP/2. If the client
creates a grouping for HTTP/3-capable endpoints and
HTTP/2-capable endpoints, 2001:db8::2 would exist in both
groups (assuming that all other security properties are
the same).

Connection racing as described in {{connections}} applies
to different destination endpoint options within one of these groups.
The logic for prioritizing and falling back between groups
of endpoints with different security properties and protocol
properties is implementation-defined.

### When to Apply Application Preferences

Whether or not specific application protocols or security features
are grouped separately is a client application decision. Clients
SHOULD avoid grouping and sorting separately in cases where their
use of an application protocol or feature is non-critical.

For example, an HTTP client loading a simple webpage may not see a large
difference between using HTTP/3 or HTTP/2, and thus can group the ALPNs together
to respect service-determined priorities where HTTP/3 might be
prioritized behind HTTP/2. However, another client might see significant
performance improvements by using HTTP/3's ability to send unreliable
frames for its application use-case and will group HTTP/3 before HTTP/2.

Similarly, a particular application might require or strongly prefer the
use of TLS ECH for privacy-sensitive traffic, while others might
support ECH opportunistically.

{{Section 8 of SVCB-ECH}} recommends against SVCB record sets that contain
some answers that include ECH configuration and some that don't, but notes
that such cases are possible. It is possible that services only include
ECH configurations on SVCB answers that are prioritized behind others
that don't include ECH configurations; for example, this might be
used as an experimentation or roll-out strategy. Due to such cases, clients
ought not to arbitrarily group ECH-containing answers and sort them
first if they won't use the ECH information, or if the connection would
not benefit from the use of ECH. However, for cases where there is a
reason for an application preference for ECH, the client MAY group
and prioritize those answers separately. Even though this might conflict
with the published service record priorities, any answers published
by the service are eligible to be used by clients, and clients can
choose to use them.

## Grouping By Service Priority {#service-group}

The next step of grouping and sorting is to group across different
services (as defined by SVCB/HTTPS records), and sort these groups
by priority.

This step allows server-published priorities to be reflected
in the client connection establishment algorithm.

SVCB {{SVCB}} records indicate a priority for each ServiceMode response.
This priority applies to any IPv4 or IPv6 address hints in the record
itself, as well as any addresses received on A or AAAA queries for the
name in the ServiceMode record. The priority in a SVCB ServiceMode record is
always greater than 0.

SVCB answers with the lowest numerical value (such as 1) are sorted
first, and answers with higher numerical values are sorted later.

Note that a SVCB record with the TargetName "." applies to the owner
name in the record, and the priority of that SVCB record applies to
any A or AAAA records for the same owner name. These answers are
sorted according to that SVCB record's priority.

All endpoints received from a particular SVCB service (within a group
as defined in {{application-group}}), either by an associated AAAA
or A record or address hints, SHOULD be separated into a group by
the client. These service-based groups SHOULD then be sorted
using the service priority.

For cases where the answers do not include any SVCB/HTTPS information,
or if all of the answers are associated with the same SVCB/HTTPS record,
this step is trivial: all answers belong to one group that has the same
priority.

When there are multiple services, and thus multiple groups, with the
same priority, the client SHOULD shuffle these groups randomly.

If there are some SVCB/HTTPS services received, but there are AAAA or A
records that do not have an associated service (for example, if no
SVCB/HTTPS record is received for the original name using the "."
TargetName), the unassociated addresses SHOULD be put in a group of
endpoints that is prioritized at the end of the list.

## Sorting Destination Endpoints Within Groups {#endpoint-sorting}

Within each group of endpoints, after grouping based on the logic
in {{application-group}} and {{service-group}}, the client sorts
the endpoints based on preference and historical data.

First, the client MUST sort the endpoints using Destination Address
Selection ({{!RFC6724, Section 6}}).

If the client is stateful and has a history of expected round-trip
times (RTTs) for the routes to access each endpoint's IP address,
it SHOULD add a Destination Address Selection rule between rules 8 and 9 that prefers
addresses with lower RTTs. If the client keeps track of which
addresses it used in the past, it SHOULD add another Destination
Address Selection rule between the RTT rule and rule 9, which prefers
used addresses over unused ones. This helps servers that use the
client's IP address during authentication, as is the case for TCP
Fast Open {{?RFC7413}} and some Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)
cookies. This historical data MUST be partitioned using the same
boundaries used for privacy-sensitive information specific to that endpoint,
and MUST NOT be used across different Provisioning Domains (PvDs)
{{PvD}}. The data SHOULD be flushed whenever a device changes the
PvD to which it is attached. However, if a client can reliably
identify a previously attached PvD, it MAY retain and resume using
historical data associated with that PvD upon reconnection. Clients
that use historical data MUST ensure that clients with different
historical data will eventually converge toward the same behaviors.
For example, clients can periodically ignore historical data to ensure
that fresh addresses are attempted.

Next, the client SHOULD modify the ordered list to interleave
address families. Whichever address family is first in the list
should be followed by an endpoint of the other address family. For example,
if the first endpoint in the sorted list has an IPv6 address, then
the first IPv4 endpoint should be moved up in the list to be second
in the list. An implementation MAY choose to favor one
address family more by allowing multiple addresses of that
family to be attempted before trying the next.
The number of contiguous endpoints of the first address family of
properties will be referred to as the "Preferred Address Family
Count" and can be a configurable value. This avoids waiting through a
long list of endpoints for a given address family if connectivity
over that address family is impaired.

Note that the endpoint selection described in this section only
applies to destination addresses; Source Address Selection
({{!RFC6724-UPDATE=I-D.ietf-6man-rfc6724-update, Section 3.2}}) is performed
once per destination address and is out of scope of this document.

# Connection Attempts {#connections}

Once the list of endpoints received up to this point has been
constructed, the client will attempt to make connections. In order to
avoid unreasonable network load, connection attempts SHOULD NOT be
made simultaneously. Instead, one connection attempt to a single
endpoint is started first, followed by the others, one at a
time. Starting a new connection attempt does not affect previous
attempts, as multiple connection attempts may occur in parallel.  Once
one of the connection attempts succeeds ({{success}}), all other
connection attempts that have not yet succeeded SHOULD be canceled.
Any endpoint that was not yet attempted as a connection SHOULD be
ignored.  At that time, any asynchronous DNS queries MAY be canceled as
new endpoints will not be used for this connection. However, the DNS
client resolver SHOULD still process DNS replies from the network for
a short period of time (recommended to be 1 second), as they will
populate the DNS cache and can be used for subsequent connections.

If grouping endpoints by application or security requirements
({{application-group}}) produced multiple groups, the application
SHOULD start with connection attempts to the most preferred option.
The policy for attempting any endpoints outside of the most preferred
group is up to the client implementation and out of scope for this document.

If grouping endpoints by service ({{service-group}}) produced multiple
groups, all of the endpoints of the first group SHOULD be started
before starting attempts using the next group. Attempts across service groups
SHOULD be allowed to continue in parallel; in effect, the groups
are flattened into a single list. The intent of these groups is to
strictly prioritize the most preferred service. Therefore, if a higher
priority group has many endpoints, there is a potential for long
delays before falling back to lower priority groups.

A simple implementation can have a fixed delay for how long to wait
before starting the next connection attempt. This delay is referred to
as the "Connection Attempt Delay". One recommended value for a default
delay is 250 milliseconds. A more nuanced implementation's delay
should correspond to the time when the previous attempt is retrying
its handshake (such as sending a second TCP SYN or a second QUIC
Initial), based on the retransmission timer ({{!RFC6298}},
{{?RFC9002}}). If the client has historical RTT data gathered from
other connections to the same host or prefix, it can use this
information to influence its delay. Note that this algorithm should
only try to approximate the time of the first handshake packet
retransmission, and not any further retransmissions that may be
influenced by exponential timer back off. Clients that support
session resumption mechanisms (such as TLS session tickets
{{?RFC8446}} or QUIC 0-RTT {{?RFC9001}}) SHOULD use the same
Connection Attempt Delay for resumed connections as for new
connections.

The Connection Attempt Delay MUST have a lower bound, especially if it
is computed using historical data. More specifically, a subsequent
connection MUST NOT be started within 10 milliseconds of the previous
attempt. The recommended minimum value is 100 milliseconds, which is
referred to as the "Minimum Connection Attempt Delay". This minimum
value is required to avoid congestion collapse in the presence of high
packet-loss rates. The Connection Attempt Delay SHOULD have an upper
bound, referred to as the "Maximum Connection Attempt Delay". The
current recommended value is 2 seconds.

An implementation MAY increase the Connection Attempt Delay for each
additional connection attempt that is started while earlier attempts
are still in progress, multiplying the delay by a fixed factor (the
"Connection Attempt Delay Multiplier") for each such attempt. The
multiplier scales whichever base delay the implementation uses: the
RTT-derived estimate described above when RTT data is available, or the
fixed default otherwise. A short base delay starts a first fallback
quickly, while the multiplier spaces out later attempts so the
aggregate attempt rate stays low. For example, with a fixed base delay
of 50 milliseconds and a multiplier of 2, attempts are started at 0,
50, 150, 350, and 750 milliseconds. A multiplier of 1 keeps the delay
constant. When a multiplier greater than 1 is used, the base delay MAY
be below the recommended Minimum Connection Attempt Delay, but the 10
millisecond hard lower bound still applies.

The Connection Attempt Delay is used to set a timer, referred to as
the "Next Connection Attempt Timer". Whenever this timer fires and
a connection has not been successfully established, the next
connection attempt starts, and the timer either is reset to a new
delay value or, in the case of the end of the list being reached,
is cancelled. Note that the delay value can be different for each
connection attempt (depending on the protocol being used and
the estimated RTT).

## Determining successful connection establishment {#success}

The determination of when a connection attempt has successfully
completed (and other attempts can be cancelled) ultimately depends
on the client application's interpretation of the connection
state being ready to use. This will generally include at least
the transport-level handshake with the remote endpoint (such as
the TCP or QUIC handshake), but can involve other higher-level
handshakes or state checks as well.

Client connections that use TCP only (without TLS or another protocol
on top, such as for unencrypted HTTP connections) will determine
successful establishment based on completing the TCP handshake
only. When TLS is used on top of TCP (such as for encrypted HTTP
connections), clients SHOULD wait for the TLS handshake to
successfully complete before cancelling other connection
attempts. This is particularly useful for networks in which a
TCP-terminating proxy might be causing TCP handshakes to succeed
quickly, even though end-to-end connectivity with the TLS-terminating
server will fail. QUIC connections inherently include a secure
handshake in their main handshakes, and thus usually only need to
wait for a single handshake to complete.

Beyond TCP, TLS, and/or QUIC handshakes, clients may also wait for
other requirements to be met before determining that the connection
establishment was successful. For example, clients generally validate that
the server's certificate provided via TLS is trusted, and that operation can
be asynchronous.

In cases where the connection establishment determination goes beyond
the initial transport handshake, the Next Connection Attempt Timer
ought to be adjusted after the initial transport handshake is completed.
When the connection establishment makes progress, but has not completed,
the timer SHOULD be extended to a new value that represents an estimated
time for the full connection establishment to complete.

For example, consider a case where connection establishment involves
both a TCP handshake and a TLS handshake. If the timer is initially set
to be roughly at the time when a TCP SYN packet would be retransmitted,
and the TCP handshake completes before the timer fires, the timer should
be adjusted to allow for the time in which the TLS handshake could complete.

While transport layer handshakes generally do not have restrictions on
attempts to establish a connection, some cryptographic handshakes may
be dependent on SVCB ServiceMode records and could impose limitations on
establishing a connection.  For instance, ECH-capable clients may
become SVCB-reliant clients ({{Section 3 of SVCB}}) when SVCB records
contain the "ech" SvcParamKey {{SVCB-ECH}}. If the
client is either an SVCB-reliant client or a SVCB-optional client that
might switch to SVCB-reliant connection establishment during the
process, the client MUST wait for SVCB records before proceeding with the
cryptographic handshake.

## Handling Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

The `alpn` and `no-default-alpn` SvcParamKeys in SVCB records indicate the
"SVCB ALPN set," which specifies the underlying transport protocols
supported by the associated service endpoint. When the client requests
SVCB records, it SHOULD perform the procedure specified in {{Section 7.1.2
of SVCB}} to determine the underlying transport protocols that both
the client and the service endpoint support. The client SHOULD NOT
attempt to make a connection to a service endpoint whose SVCB ALPN set
does not contain any protocols that the client supports. For example,
suppose the client is an HTTP client that only supports TCP-based
versions such as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and it receives the following
HTTPS record:

~~~
 example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc1.example.com. (
     alpn="h3" no-default-alpn ipv6hint=2001:db8::2 )
~~~

In this case, attempting a connection to 2001:db8::2 or any other
address resolved for `svc1.example.com` would be incorrect because the
record indicates that `svc1.example.com` only supports HTTP/3, based on
the ALPN value of "h3".

If the client is an HTTP client that supports both Alt-Svc
{{?AltSvc=RFC7838}} and SVCB (HTTPS) records, the client SHOULD ensure
that connection attempts are consistent with both the Alt-Svc
parameters and the SVCB ALPN set, as specified in {{Section 9.3 of
SVCB}}.

## Dropping or Pending Connection Attempts

Some situations related to handling SVCB responses can
require connection attempts to be dropped, or pended until
SVCB responses return.

{{Section 3.1 of SVCB}} describes client behavior for handling
resolution failures when responses are "cryptographically protected"
using DNSSEC {{?DNSSEC=RFC9364}} or encrypted DNS ({{?DOT=RFC7858}},
{{?DOH=RFC8484}}, or {{?DOQ=RFC9250}}, for example). If SVCB
resolution fails when using cryptographic protection, clients
SHOULD abandon connection attempts altogether to avoid
downgrade attacks.

Use of cryptographic protection in DNS can influence other
parts of Happy Eyeballs connection establishment, as well.

Situations in which DNS is not protected allow for any records
to be blocked or modified, so security properties derived from
SVCB records are opportunistic only. However, when DNS is cryptographically
protected, clients can be stricter about relying on the properties
from SVCB records.

{{Section 5.1 of SVCB}} explains that clients "MUST NOT transmit any
information that could be altered by the SVCB response until it arrives",
and specifically mentions properties that affect the TLS ClientHello.
This restriction specifically applies when a client's behavior will
be altered by the SVCB response, which depends both on the client
implementation's ability to support a particular feature, as well
as the client implementation's willingness to rely on the SVCB
response to enable a particular feature.

Based on this, clients in some scenarios MUST pend starting
a TLS handshake (either after TCP or as part of QUIC) until SVCB
responses have been received, even after the "Resolution Delay"
defined in {{resolution}} has been reached. Specifically, clients
MUST pend starting handshakes if *all* of the following are true:

1. DNS responses are cryptographically protected with DNSSEC or
encrypted DNS. Note that, if unencrypted and unsigned DNS is used, SVCB
information is opportunistic; clients MAY wait for SVCB responses
but do not need to.

1. The client implementation supports parsing and using a particular
security-related SVCB parameter, such as the "ech" SvcParamKey
{{SVCB-ECH}}. (In contrast,
implementations that do not support actively using ECH do
not need to wait for SVCB resolution if that is the only
reason to do so).

1. The client relies on the presence of the particular
SVCB-related parameter to enable the relevant protocol feature.
For example, if a connection attempt would normally be
using cleartext HTTP unless an HTTPS DNS record would
cause the client to upgrade, the client needs to
wait for the record; however, if the client already
would be using HTTP over TLS, then it is not relying
on that signal from SVCB. As another example, some SVCB
properties can affect the TLS ClientHello in ways that optimize
performance (like `tls-supported-groups` {{?I-D.ietf-tls-key-share-prediction}})
but only aim to save round trips. The other TLS groups
can be discovered through the TLS handshake itself, instead
of SVCB, and thus do not require waiting for SVCB responses.

# DNS Answer Changes During Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup {#changes}

If, during the course of connection establishment, the DNS answers
change by either adding resolved endpoints (for example due to DNS
push notifications {{?RFC8765}}) or removing previously resolved
endpoints (for example, due to expiry of the TTL on that DNS record),
the client should react based on its current progress. Additionally, endpoints
from SVCB IP hints SHOULD be removed from the list once A and AAAA records are
received for the corresponding name, if the endpoints from the hints are absent from the
received records {{Section 7.3 of SVCB}}.

If an endpoint is removed from the list that already had a connection
attempt started, the connection attempt SHOULD NOT be canceled, but
rather be allowed to continue. If the removed endpoint had not yet
had a connection attempt started, it SHOULD be removed from the list
of endpoints to try.

If an endpoint is added to the list, its position SHOULD be determined by
applying the sorting rules (see {{sorting}}) to the complete list of endpoints,
including those previously received. This ensures that sorting rules, such as address family
interleaving, are maintained correctly regardless of when endpoints arrive. For
example, consider a connection attempt in which only IPv6 addresses
are available initially, and an attempt to one IPv6 address endpoint is already in progress.
Then, when IPv4 addresses are later received, an IPv4 address endpoint should be placed next in the list of endpoints to attempt
(to account for interleaving address families) ahead of any remaining IPv6 address endpoints, as if it had been available initially.

When DNS answers change while a Connection Attempt Delay timer is running, the
client MAY reschedule the timer. While a DNS update alone does not justify
rescheduling the timer, if at least one connection attempt started before the
DNS update has not made progress within an expected time window, the client MAY treat this as a signal that
the previous addresses may no longer be viable and fire the timer sooner
to start a connection attempt to the next address in the updated list, subject
to the Minimum Connection Attempt Delay.

# Handling NAT64 Networks {#nat64}

NAT64 {{NAT64}} is an IPv6 transition protocol that allows
clients with IPv6-only connectivity to access IPv4-only peers
outside the local link. When NAT64 is in use, an IPv6 prefix,
referred to as PREF64, is used on by the NAT for synthesizing
IPv4 addresses into IPv6 addresses.

## Discovering PREF64

Clients can discover a network's PREF64 in one of the following ways:

1. From a Router Advertisement option ({{!PREF64=RFC8781}})

1. From a DNS query for ipv4only.arpa ({{!RFC7050}})

If a network with IPv6-only connectivity does not provide the prefix
in a Router Advertisement {{PREF64}}, clients SHOULD send the DNS
query to discover the prefix {{RFC7050}}.

Networks that use NAT64 might also include DNS64 {{?DNS64=RFC6147}},
in which the DNS resolver synthesizes A answers into AAAA answers.
However, with the prefix available from router advertisements {{PREF64}},
networks might choose to not deploy DNS64, as the latter has a number
of disadvantages (see {{Section 4.3.4 of ?V6-MOSTLY=I-D.ietf-v6ops-6mops}}).

To ensure compatibility with any NAT64 network, whenever the client
detects a NAT64 prefix, from either of the options reference above,
clients MUST send A queries in addition to AAAA queries (as
specified in {{queries}}). This allows the client to receive any
existing IPv4 A records and perform local NAT64 address synthesis,
eliminating the network's need to run DNS64.

## Handling Synthesized Answers

Synthesized IPv6 addresses (IPv4 addresses that have been
synthensized into IPv6 addresses either locally using PREF64
or by a DNS64 resolver) MUST be de-synthesized into IPv4 addresses
before being used by the Happy Eyeballs client for grouping and
sorting ({{sorting}}), and connecting. These addresses might
be re-synthesized into IPv6 addresses (see {{synthesizing}}),
in which case implementations can choose to optimize processing
by storing the original address, but still using the IPv4 address
for purposes of sorting and route lookups.

IPv6 addresses received from AAAA records might come from DNS64
{{DNS64}}. Clients that are aware of the PREF64 value MUST check
to see if an IPv6 address received from DNS is actually an IPv4
address.

## Synthesizing IPv6 Addresses During Connection Establishment {#synthesizing}

When a client has discovered PREF64, it can use the prefix to
synthesize IPv4 addresses into IPv6 addresses as defined in {{!RFC6052}}.

If the Happy Eyeballs client is attempting a connection
to an IPv4 address when there is no IPv4 route that applies for that
address, then the client MUST synthesize this address into an
IPv6 address using the PREF64. These IPv4 addresses can come
from DNS (via A records or IPv4 address hints received in
SVCB/HTTPS records), or from de-synthesizing IPv6 addresses,
or from IPv4 literal addresses passed by an application.
This solution is similar to "Bump-in-the-Host" {{!RFC6535}},
but is implemented inside the Happy Eyeballs client.

Note that NAT64 address synthesis is not always required or possible.
Some IPv4 prefixes are scoped to a given host or network and do not require
synthesis, such as 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16, and 255.255.255.255/32.

# Summary of Configurable Values

The values that may be configured as defaults on a client for use in
Happy Eyeballs are as follows:

- Resolution Delay ({{resolution}}): The time to wait for AAAA and/or SVCB/HTTPS
records after receiving an A record. Recommended to be 50 milliseconds.

- Preferred Address Family Count ({{sorting}}): The number of
endpoints belonging to the preferred address family (such as IPv6)
that should be attempted before attempting the next address family.
Recommended to be 1; 2 may be used to more aggressively favor a
particular combination of address family and protocol.

- Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The time to wait between
connection attempts in the absence of RTT data. Recommended to be
250 milliseconds.

- Minimum Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The minimum time to
wait between connection attempts. Recommended to be 100
milliseconds. MUST NOT be less than 10 milliseconds.

- Maximum Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The maximum time to
wait between connection attempts. Recommended to be 2 seconds.

- Connection Attempt Delay Multiplier ({{connections}}): An optional
factor by which the Connection Attempt Delay is multiplied for each
additional concurrent connection attempt in progress. Recommended to be
1 (a constant delay); values greater than 1 grow the delay per attempt
and allow a shorter base delay.


The delay values described in this section were determined
empirically by measuring the timing of connections on a very wide set
of production devices. They were picked to reduce wait times noticed
by users while minimizing load on the network. As time passes, it is
expected that the properties of networks will evolve. For that
reason, it is expected that the values chosen by implementations
will change over time. Implementors MAY use values different from the
recommended values listed above, without changing this specification,
as long as they do not violate any of the normative requirements (such
as minimum delays).

# Limitations

Happy Eyeballs will handle initial connection failures at the transport
layer (such as TCP or QUIC); however, other failures or performance
issues may still affect the chosen connection.

## Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery

Connections that use TCP only (without TLS or another protocol on top)
perform connection racing only during the TCP handshake. Such connections
can encounter issues where the TCP handshake (using small packets) completes
but then large packets are dropped or incorrectly handled by the network
due to a small MTU being configured somewhere in the network.
Such issues might be more likely with IPv6 traffic  {{?RFC8900}}
due to the network being unable to fragment IPv6 packets
and associated issues with Path MTU Discovery, such as with ICMPv6 PTB
messages not making it back to the client.

This problem can also occur when TLS is used, but the larger
messages used in many TLS handshakes are often sufficient to
ensure maximum-size TCP segments are deliverable. For QUIC
connections, a minimum MTU of at least 1200 bytes
{{!RFC9000, Section 8.1-5}} is guaranteed, but there is a chance that
larger values may not be available.

Solving these issues is out of scope of this document. One suggested
approach is to use "Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery" {{!RFC4821}}.

## Application Layer

If the DNS returns multiple endpoints for different application
servers, the application itself may not be operational and functional
on all of them. Common examples include Transport Layer Security
(TLS) and HTTP.

## Hiding Operational Issues

It has been observed in practice that Happy Eyeballs can hide issues
in networks. For example, if a misconfiguration causes IPv6 to
consistently fail on a given network while IPv4 is still functional,
Happy Eyeballs may impair the operator's ability to notice the issue.
It is recommended that network operators deploy external means of
monitoring to ensure functionality of all address families.

# Security Considerations

Note that applications should not rely upon a stable
hostname-to-address mapping to ensure any security properties, since
DNS results may change between queries. Happy Eyeballs may make it
more likely that subsequent connections to a single hostname use
different IP addresses.

When using HTTP, HTTPS resource records indicate that clients should
require HTTPS when connecting to an origin (see {{Section 9.5 of
!RFC9460}}), so an active attacker can attempt a downgrade attack by
interfering with the successful delivery of HTTPS resource records.
When clients use insecure DNS mechanisms, any on-path attacker can
simply drop HTTPS resource records, so clients cannot tell the
difference between an attack and a resolver that fails to respond to
HTTPS queries.

However, when using cryptographically protected DNS mechanisms, as
described in {{Section 3.1 of !RFC9460}}, both SVCB-reliant and
SVCB-optional clients MUST NOT send any unencrypted data after the TCP
handshake completes unless they have received a valid HTTPS response.
Those clients need to complete a TLS handshake before proceeding if
that response is non-negative.
